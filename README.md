## [About](#about)

This repository contains experimental code and programs. Feel free to do 
as you wish with any of it. Sometimes I get ideas and want to toss them 
around or I'll want to try something out, so I created this repository for 
just that purpose. 

Nothing in this repository is finished or really meant to be finished it's 
just ideas. If you have any ideas on how to add to any of mine definitely 
let me know submit a `Pull Request` or just hit me up on one of my social 
links. 

I write code/markup in various languages so there will be a mix of file types
and ideas. Mostly the
following:
- C++
- C++/CLR
- Python
- Shell (Bash, Zsh, Pwsh)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- Json
- XML

I'm a way better software dev than I am a web developer but I love using CSS.

### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to 
never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently 
reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email 
me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). 
I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
